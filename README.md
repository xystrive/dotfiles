## What is this repository?

Hey there! :wave:

This repository stores configuration files for a variety of different software I currently use (most likely).

You can run the `configure.sh` bash script, located inside `$THIS_REPO_ROOT_DIR/nvim` to do any required configuration for plugins seamlessly.

:warning: Beware, you might need to install dependencies on your local machine.
